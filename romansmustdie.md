### Exploring the Intersection of _Archaeogaming_ with Agent Based Simulation

---

killscreen article on umberto eco & open worlds: "our interpretations of the world are necessary tools for making sense of it, but fixing onto these beliefs as if they revealed the true nature of things can be dangers"

- video of behaviourspace running

---

- what this sim is trying to do

--

- game like elements of it: in fact, first edition had 'smite' button, which made it not so much ABM, but game! because:

---

ABM: are games that play themselves

---

unpack that idea. the smite button... a direct agency? normally ABM allow you to set the parameters up, not encouraged to change things while it's all running...

---

- to turn it into 'proper' sim, I had to remove myself.

---

 ? some clever point
 [something concerning agency](#DONE:40)

---

- What simulation does
[make some pretty diagrams](#DONE:20)

---

archae abm tries to embed our understanding of phenomena x from the past into code; testing the consequences of that belief (whether for prediction or explanation)

---

in history games, the rulesets are akin to historiography, so invert and 'think of the rule systems that characterize various brands of history as constituting the potential rule systems for game play'

---

typology of games according to genre is really a fruitless errand as 'genre' is mostly marketing conveince. Kee & Graham adapted Aarseth typology, emphasing the treatment of time & space to help determine how games match according to historiography

---

use table 13.2 to categorize two games that are most akin to ABM

---

then use table 13.2 to break apart my archaeo sim?

---

- simulation is to video gaming as whole networks analysis is to ego networks (at least, in terms of fps)

---

In which case, and recognizing this, can we use the methods for analyzing ABM on video games?

---

### Irony

> ...the only people who can evaluate the quality of a model (i.e. other modellers) don't care about the actual results, while those who should care play safe and ignore them.

### Ditto archaeogaming

--

now re-analyze Caesar IV? & my ABM?

---

- discuss that game that actually *is* an ABM! Better get playing it within same framework

I was going to analyze 'Evolving Planet', since it is
+ self consciously an agent based simulation
+ within a gaming framework

But that'll be discussed I believe later today.

---

## So what can we be doing?
- we can't all be making video games; we are not game designers
- but as archaeologists we could be making simulations
- and we could swap some humans in there

---

## hubnet
- archaeologists use Netlogo for AMB
- Netlogo
- integrated simulation and modeling environment
-
"We ask: what is the cognitive and motivational significance of supporting real-time first-person-in-relation-to-an-evolving-whole experience for making sense of complex dynamic systems"

Romans must die: but for what?
