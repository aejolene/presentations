Note:
Why bother with AR? Ain't it just a gimmick? Make a Pratchett allusion - Tiffany Aching- Open your eyes, then open them again? Should also perhaps map out the parts of this talk


## Map for Today's Talk

1. Seeing Ghosts 
2. Which We've Always Done
    + I want my MTV
3. Sense and Sensibility (_or, manipulating breaks in presence_)
4. AR for Archaeological Research
5. AR for Public Archaeology
6. WIIFM

We've always been augmenting reality. But maybe we could make things a bit more... awesome. image: http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/cakes-cottages-and-manky-bones/

Note:
Stu Eve app. This video continues to blow me away. No AR app I've seen in the intervening years comes as close.

from your smartphone to disney world to the oculus & hololens. archaeologists have always been working along this continuum.


## AR in the Wild

Note: 
mostly advertising world - but clearly Microsoft, Google, & others are making *huge* bets here. - notice the progression here: http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/26/ogmento-first-ar-gaming-startup-to-win-vc-funding/ to http://www.flybymedia.com/


## $150 _Billion_ Industry?

![http://www.clickonline.com/Images/Uploads/2015/219/Original/Rift-Time-Parody.png](http://www.clickonline.com/Images/Uploads/2015/219/Original/Rift-Time-Parody.png)

[This report](http://www.digi-capital.com/reports/#augmented-virtual-reality) makes that claim. The money's not in gear.

It's in _experiences_. 

Note:
Google invests in 'magic leap' to tune of $542 million. Nobody's even seen what they're doing yet. 'Glass' is being relaunched as an industry (not consumer) product. Junaio/Metaio have been bought by Apple. Existing AR sdk's etc now all want ridiculous subscriptions, where the sdk itself is free but branding & pushing content is not (worrying implication there)

### Ok, so much for the hype.
# _Nihil novi sub sole_
Note: this ends the intro; having looked at the geewhiz aspects, let's turn to the things that have been constant


## analogue AR
From Wall Painting to Flipbooks

## analogue VR

Stereoscopes

### 3. What gets augmented, anyway? 
## privileging the visual
![JC+A, British Museum https://www.flickr.com/photos/williamphotography/](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4023/4672892333_dd110d9d17_z.jpg)

Note: 
Something about the gaze etc. also, about touch - that tweet of lidar + pins hmmmm


## Breaks in Presence
	+ that which knocks you out of the experience
	+ What can 'ruin' a conventional AR experience?

![this child has had a break in presence](http://i.imgur.com/aZYsJmP.png)

<small>This child has endured a break in presence.<br>https://pixabay.com/en/portrayal-portrait-crying-cry-baby-89189/</small>

Note:
Building a convincing visual AR experience, that does not cause any breaks in presence is the holy grail of Augmented Reality studies, and something that is virtually impossible to achieve. A break in presence will occur due to the mediation of the experience through a device (Head-Mounted Display, tablet computer, smartphone, etc.); the quality of the rendering of the virtual objects; the level of latency in software that delivers the experience to the eyes; the list is endless and scale-less – once you ‘solve’ one break in presence, then another occurs. The goal then can never be to completely eliminate breaks in presence, but instead to recognise them and treat them with an historian’s caution. phenomenology is not a bad word. http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1352447/1/Eve_2012_Augmented_Phenomenology.pdf

## missing a trick: sound & AR
+ sound is haptic
+ sound requires active attention
+ sound is spatialized
+ can use it to deliberately play with BiPs


## Some Augmented Audio Links

### 5. AR for the public
## Of course, these categories smear, don't they.


...'bringing impossible places to the public'...

Note: 
the assetts that this project creates could be rendered into AR easily; here they're being sent to a 3d printer...


...Pop-up books...

Kinect + Digital Projector + cheap linux box = very very cool

Note:
Many of these things out there, and this is more hydrological than archaeological, but we can see the potentials, right?

Note: 
Also excursus into Techumseh Lies Here & ARGs. This is a lovely mixture of place & audio, makes a compelling experience. list - what makes a compelling arg experience? 
1 - strong storytelling
2 - discovery/deciphering & documentation
3 - cross-media
4- blending of the boundaries b/w reality/fiction
5-
...as per this: http://readwrite.com/2007/12/26/alternate_reality_games_viral_marketing; see also McGonigle's opus

## What do archaeologists *actually* want?

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/vupSnZc.png)


[@lornarichardson](https://twitter.com/lornarichardson/status/628089085551316992) I'd like big viewers at monuments/sites which show an AR reconstruction in 3D against in situ ruins (been done?)

[@pompeiana79](https://twitter.com/Pompeiana79/status/627209677022101505) I've wanted to 3D print in 1:1 an evidence rich column from the Quadriporticus. That could be a great AR teaching tool.


[@sarahebond](https://twitter.com/SarahEBond/status/628021539544240129) I'd like to see it used to teach archaeo students about depths, keeping straight walls, and surveying. Pre-fieldwork.

[@zenobiewan](https://twitter.com/zenobiewan/status/628148410114285572) it'd be fun to look at the phenomenology of past landscapes as they were not as they exist today


[@brennawalks](https://twitter.com/brennawalks/status/628087916670095360) My AR attempts only ever made sense for outreach back home but I really wanted for site tours

[@hellokaitlin](https://twitter.com/hellokaitlin/status/628022189539856384) I would like to see it more widely used to better understand heritage in pre-development



## 6. Conclusion:
### What's in it for you
- why you should bother
	- the research potentials
	- the public outreach potentials
- the rhetorical/tactical impact
- the problem of publishing

Note:
publishing - digital gabii is working on this


### fwiw, my money's on games
![image](http://www.vivienneraper.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/escapecurseimage.jpg)

...well, not this one...


- the public will learn to use AR through games
- the conventions that game developers evolve will become the new formalisms
	- think about archaeo-tv & *its* tropes.


- games _can_ be used to write scholarly arguments
- but the mechanics and metaphors must match

# BUT NOT GAMIFIED

For as Bogost has taught us: gamification is _bullshit_.

![http://internet-marketing.mjaimpressions.com/2012/04/starting-social-game-app-gamification-strategy/](http://internet-marketing.mjaimpressions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/game-intersection.jpg)


# The future of archaeology is _awesome_, right?

![dude](http://www.chapterthree.com/sites/default/files/legacy/retro-dude.png)

...but there're still a few bugs to work out.

Note:
discuss problems of publishing, convincing others of 'scholarlyness'


# Truth.

## After the Break:
+ Building an AR app in Unity3d with Vuforia
_or_
+ Building a location-based game (with sound!) in Twine
_or_
+ Making 3d models with 123d Catch; annotating & sharing them in Sketchfab (with Oculus or Cardboard viewing!)
