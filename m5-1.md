## Charts seem unproblematic

### But who decides these conventions?
+ Who figures out that these constitute _good_ charts?
+ What are the principles that guide good chart making?

  
### What is appropriate to visualize?
+ graphical visualization contains assumptions about what consitutes knowledge
+ depends on idea that the phenomena is independent of the observer.


It's not.

They affect each other.

(but they might not affect each other symmetrically).


## Humanities visualization is *messy*

### _Data_ versus _Capta_

'data' things given => <br>
independent of the observer, certain


'capta' things taken => <br>
codependent on the observer, interpretive


### Humanities data are capta.

Graecia capta victorem cepit<br>
- Horace


Thinking about 'capta' isn't just being cute. It forces us to think about the cultural representation of data.


## The Y Axis

### Lying with charts
+ the cultural force of charts
+ the amplification of 'truthiness'

### The power of the chart wizard
+ just add data, poof!
+ and we've becomed conditioned to more-or-less accept


### Big Data
- the end of theory


- um, no.


### Population by gender, six countries

### What ambiguities here?
+ Let's look at the 1891 Census of Canada, at

http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/census/1891/Pages/about-census.aspx#c


+ even the most basic of stats depend on categorization; the process of categorization is subjective, interpretative. Graphic visualization hides this.


+ Drucker: "shift from expression of subjective into to the _subjective expression of perceived phenomena_" (emphasis SG)
+ 'count of domiciles as a factor of x' where x is the subjective...


### Takeaway:
- design to show the interpreted status of capta. 
- use as many labels as necessary!


## The X Axis
+ typically, as we're historians, we're talking time.


+ empirical mindset: time is continuous, unidirectional, homogenous

+ The fact that we are all supertired because of daylight saving's shows that time is socially constructed.


+ Drucker: humanistic time is relational. Not all days are equal.  
+ need to take into account _temporality_
+ time as a factor of x (x ~ fear, speed, anxiety, regret etc)

+ maps: space versus spatiality
+ spatiality: space as a factor of x
+ metropolitan mindset of rural Italy (SG landscape archaeology research)


## The Punchline
- humanistic visualization acknowledges and foregrounds its ambiguity
- it is a performance of interpretation, of interpreted phenomena
- use the interpretative complexity of your capta to ground your visualizations
