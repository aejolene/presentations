Weirdness of 'seeing the past'

Note:
We've always been augmenting reality. But maybe we could make things a bit more... awesome. image: http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/cakes-cottages-and-manky-bones/

...consider the Museum Diorama...

Note:
Stu Eve app. This video continues to blow me away. No AR app I've seen in the intervening years comes as close.

even an essay is an attempt at augmented or virtual reality

So we have to make things weird again, disrupt consensus

# A Brief Tangent

---

To make things weird, we first have to normalize them

---

And that means disrupting the game of being a student

Lack of grammar for the other modalities is an opportunity to figure out new ways of knowing.

Note:
photobashing ... occupies a liminal position in archae because it puts 'something captured through a mechanical process through a subjective one'
Value in it- because it 'sit[s] at an intersection of subjective processes and mechanical capture, allows for some interesting interactions and reflexivity between both sides of this discussion'. Photobashing is deformation.

---

So.<br>
...Soundbashing?

Note:
so by analogy to photobashing, take data captured from algorithmic process and punch it through a subjective process and back again.
