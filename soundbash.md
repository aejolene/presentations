...archaeologists have weird metaphors too, when you think about it...

Note:
We've always been augmenting reality. But maybe we could make things a bit more... awesome. image: http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/cakes-cottages-and-manky-bones/

...consider the Museum Diorama...

Note:
Stu Eve app. This video continues to blow me away. No AR app I've seen in the intervening years comes as close.

even essays are an attempt at augmented or virtual reality

So we have to make things weird again, disrupt consensus

the kinds of things I assign students as it's hard to push to far from the 'game of being a student' - grab examples from ocdsb presentation

---

+ sound is haptic
+ sound requires active attention
+ sound is spatialized
+ can use it to deliberately play with BiPs

Note:
A break in presence will occur due to the mediation of the experience through a device (Head-Mounted Display, tablet computer, smartphone, etc.); the quality of the rendering of the virtual objects; the level of latency in software that delivers the experience to the eyes; the list is endless and scale-less – once you ‘solve’ one break in presence, then another occurs. The goal then can never be to completely eliminate breaks in presence, but instead to recognise them and treat them with an historian’s caution.

what I'm currently getting really interested in:
Soundbashing

---

Different than soundscapes, archaeoacoustics

---

Rob Blades: <br>
"Historians merely hear the past without actually listening"

---

but similar connections with memory, sense making?

---

smashmouth video, midified: shows prior conditioning matters

---

neurology of hearing

---

haptics of sound

Rest of this workshop: let's make some noise!
