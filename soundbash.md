"Historians merely hear the past without actually listening"

---

Weirdness of 'seeing the past'

---

AR - phenomenology

VR - all essays are an attempt at 'virtual

--

gestalt viz

---

hundreds of years of getting to consensus on viz

---

map w/ north at top, TVP

---

top-down perspective, god's eye view

---

sempre dirrito!

---

So we have to make things weird again, disrupt consensus

---

mark sample post...?

---

Photobashing - stuff from tara...

---

the kinds of things I assign students as it's hard to push to far from the 'game of being a student' - grab examples from ocdsb presentation

---

but what I'm currently getting really interested in:
Soundbashing

---

Different than soundscapes, archaeoacoustics

---

but similar connections with memory, sense making?

---

smashmouth video, midified: shows prior conditioning matters

---

neurology of hearing

---

haptics of sound

---

Rest of this workshop: let's make some noise!
