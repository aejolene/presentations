#Digital History<br>and Universal Design


## Hollis' Story


### 'a product of cultural rules about what bodies should be or do'


+ assume everyone approaches information with same tools, abilities, methods? risk excluding large % of people


"In fact, such tools do the work of disabiling people by preventing them from using digital resources altogether." - [George H Williams](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/44)


## As hist3812a showed, every digital tool encodes assumptions about how the world works.


Consider 'The Templated Self'
> A self or identity that is produced through various participation architectures, the act of producing a virtual or digital representation of self by filling out a user interface with personal information.

[Amber Case](http://cyborganthropology.com/Templated_Self)


Who designs these participation architectures? And Why is that important?

70% of Google employees are male. 61% are white and 30% Asian. Of Google's "technical" employees. 83% are male. 60% of those are white and 34% are Asian.
<br>70% of Apple employees are male. 55% are white and 15% are Asian. 80% of Apple's "technical" employees are male.
<br>69% of Facebook employees are male. 57% are white and 34% are Asian. 85% of Facebook's "technical" employees are male.
<br>70% of Twitter employees are male. 59% are white and 29% are Asian. 90% of Twitter's "technical" employees are male.

## Screen Essentialism
+ The fallacy of assuming that every interaction will take place through the screen
+ Projection bias & false consciousness bias


### There is no natural way to interact with 1s and 0s
that make up the data we are interested in creating, transmitting, receiving and using; there is only the model we have chosen to think of as natural.<br>
[George H Williams](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/44)


## Is a screen reader a disability or an ability?

## What if you designed for sound?

## Universal Design 
+ design for the largest possible audience in mind
+ opens us up to different/new/better/alternate ways of representing information
+ if 'open access' means anything, **it means this!**


+ accessible design & mobile design overlap to a high degree<br><br> thus futureproofs as well!
+ it's more efficient (splitting content from its representation)
+ and there may well be legal obligations too


# Think about UD in your project
+ you might not be able to design universally _for this project_
+ but you can reflect, in your paradata document, about what opportunities you've foreclosed by not having your project as accessible as it might otherwise be.
