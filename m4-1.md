# Visualizing your Data



#Qualitative data vs Quantitative
+ how do you see patterns in words?


## You count 'em.
+ or, you realize that you can count _the patterns_ that clusters of words make up

## Many tools available
+ and many approaches
+ traditionally, easier to get money to develop a new tool than to do research _using_ that tool

## OverView Project

+ overviewproject.org
+ Look at distributions of words over a corpus
+ TF-IDF


## How it works

+ The cat sat on the mat. Then the cat chased the rat.
+ The cat slept all day on the mat.
+ The rat ran across the floor.


### Strip the stopwords

+ cat sat mat cat chased rat
+ cat slept all day mat
+ rat ran across floor


### Count what remains

### TF-IDF
![image to that re cats](http://overview.ap.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Document-similarity-scores.png)
+ compare every pair of documents
+ multiply the frequencies of corresponding words


### Visualize

## Topic Modeling
+ many approaches go under the term 'topic modeling'
+ most common in humanities approaches: LDA


## Topic Modeling Gettysburg Address

## War v Governance
+ What % of this text is composed by a 'war' topic?
+ How do you know what 'war' words are?


## Teaching the computer
+ supervised vs. unsupervised


## How the world works
+ we all just pull from bags of words, right?
