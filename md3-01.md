### Transcription v Text Encoding
- remember when we transcribed text in HIST2809? What was the goal of transcription?



### quick intro to TEI
![image](http://www.tei-c.org/system/modules/org.tei.www/_common/images/banner.jpg)

- tags to identify the semantic content of text
- XML


### transformable
- as when we write in md, content is separate from formatting
- just as HTML can be styled w CSS, TEI XML can be transformed w stylesheets, xlst 


### simple files, multiple uses
- one file with our markup, our annotations, our scholarly apparatus
- xlst files to transform for our needs
- open in a browser


### specialist tools
- can do it in simple notepad++ or textwrangler or sim, *but*:
- [OxygenXML](http://www.oxygenxml.com/)
- [HisTEI](http://www.histei.info/p/home.html)
- [repo of stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets)

### practice
+ The park has a lovely duck pond. 


+ Our butcher sold us some rotten meat yesterday afternoon. 


+ Dr. Havingsbury goes to church every Sunday. 


+ Mrs. Wellington, who was wearing her Wellington boots, accompanied me on a trip, where we saw a statue of the Duke of Wellington in Wellington, New Zealand near the Wellington's Boot public house- where I hear they serve excellent beef Wellington for lunch. I do adore Mrs. Wellington. 



## Colonial Newspaper Database

- what tags does the historian use?
- what does the xlst turn the XML into?



## Next day:
- not exactly wrangling, but let's talk Pandoc (system for transforming your md into other formats)
- regular expressions
- open refine



### and if time allows
- this module's exercises, things to watch out for
- other business?
