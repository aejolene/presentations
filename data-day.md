### Big Data Has Ever Been With Us

+ Think of the sheer variety of experience that created that data!

<small> Monte Testaccio, 19th C, Rome: one giant repository of archaeological data. 

20 000 m2, 35 m high, 580 000 m3.</small>


### Think how much data the Carp Landfill contains!

Note: archae & history brings to big data ideas of context, of 4 dimensional representations of data, of narrative and change over time. broadly, archae & history think about problems of conservation over time, of preserving now in formats to allow qs haven't thought of using techs haven't invented yet.

You can't just turn on the hose. 

'Big Data' are data that are too big for you to deal with using your 'regular' methodology. 


### That's why folks like Ian Milligan
## are inventing new ways to do history, digitally
![ian's slide](https://ianmilli.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/milligan_lt_big_data.png?w=665&h=499)

+ Between 1996 and 2009, it ammased > 38 million pages
+ 2009, Yahoo nuked it. Utterly.
+ [Ian's work is exploring these digital ruins](http://ianmilligan.ca/2015/03/25/herrenhausen-big-data-lightning-talk-finding-community-in-the-ruins-of-geocities/#more-2577).


### That's why I'm teaching history students big history methods
## Let's see what they're up to.

## 'Data Speak for Themselves'?

Nope. 

Sorry.


### Data are Capta
datum - is something given, out there, objective

capta - is something taken, brought in, subjective.


### What we're really talking about is
## Big Capta

Every choice you make - about what to collect, how to collect it, how you munge it, how you clean it, how you represent it - depends on your worldview. 

That is to say, theory helps us unpack worldviews and their artefacts.


### Big data needs the humanities
![https://andrewsidea.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/ratatouille1.jpg](https://andrewsidea.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/ratatouille1.jpg)

+ Remember, data are always cooked. 
+ Think of us as food critics.


 
### Nah. Not critics. 
## Actually, we're storytellers
![princessbride](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/culture_test/kelly_storytelling_post.jpg)

That's why Humanities & Big Data are not in competition.


### They are complementary. 
### Together, they tell a better story.


![hooke](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Hooke-microscope.png)

+ the tools of big data allow me a macroscopic view on my materials

+ they help me figure out where to focus my microscope


+ and the microscope tells me where the macroscope needs adjusting.

### (And so we avoid just-so stories)

## My research
![minion](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/411694091538165760/WO9XkQZa.jpeg)

+ I explore the tools themselves, & help others to use them wisely
+ http://electricarchaeology.ca


+ I map historical consciousness online
+ I simulate social processes of the past, grounded in archaeological data

+ I do computational historiography (aka topic modeling archaeological archives)
