# Basics

![edges](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.2%20edges.png)


### Nodes and Edges can have _attributes_
![nodes and edges](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.3%20nodes%20and%20edges.png)


### Kinds of edges
![dyad](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.4%20dyad.png)


![dyad reciprocal](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.5%20dyad%20reciprocal.png)


![triad transivity](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.7%20triad%20transivity.png)

+ Transivity is the concept that when A is connected to B and C, B and C will also be connected. 


### Kinds of networks
![unweighted](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.9%20unweighted.png)

+ unweighted


![weighted](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.8%20weighted.png)

+ weighted


![directed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.10%20directed.png)

+ directed


![citation](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.12%20citation.png)

+ citation graph as directed network


![bipartite](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.13%20collapsing%20a%20bipartite.png)


## Exercise
+ Build a social network of students in this class
+ Who are the nodes?
+ What are the links?


![collapsing bipartite](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/5.13%20collapsing%20a%20bipartite.png)

+ nb many network metrics assume 1-mode graph. That's not to say they can't be calculated on a 2-mode graph; it's just they might not mean what you think they mean.



## Metrics


_Path Length_

## The difference a metric makes

+ Here we go to Clement Levallois' tutorial on [why networks](http://www.clementlevallois.net/gephi/tuto/en/why%20network%20viz_en.pdf) p35


![same-network-different-centralities](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/same-network-different-centralities.png)
+ same network, different centralities!


![directed matters](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37716296/3907b/directed-matters.png)
+ and directionality matters!
