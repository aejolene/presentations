weekly in-class presentations
=============

These presentations are made with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). They can be viewed here as markdown formatted files (and so, printed nicely). Here they are [live](http://hist3907b-winter2015.github.io/presentations/#/).

Here's [how to host reveal.js on github](https://cynng.wordpress.com/2014/10/08/using-reveal-js-on-github-pages-for-your-presentations/).

Module 2 Session 1 - Finding Data. There was no slide deck for this day. Rather, I discussed the readings for Module 2 in terms of computing history, the evolution of search, the nature of the early Web and early search engines. We talked about the ways 'search' was not theorized, and the implications of that for how we find data online. We talked about the various ways we might encounter data online, and we walked through the resources for and introudction to the exercises.

Module 2 Session 2 - Search & Research - Shawn Anctil. Shawn Anctil, a PhD student in the Department here, came and talked about the ways one could use the artefacts of the search process itself as fodder for asking good historical questions - especially in terms of public history. He demonstrated the use of various tools and analytics for exploring these.

Module 2 Session 3 - In the Discovery Centre in the Library. APIs; wget; collaboration and connections; Twitter Search & its API and @edsu's TWARC, NodeXL.

[Module 2 Session 4 - Working with wget](http://hist3907b-winter2015.github.io/presentations/md2-04.html#/)

[Module 3 Session 1 - Wrangling Data](http://hist3907b-winter2015.github.io/presentations/md3-01.html#/)

[Module 3 Session 2 - How'd they do that?](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that-the-video/) Today's session can be done in the comfort of your own home, at a coffee shop, or where'er you'd like. I would like you to watch Miriams Posner's discussion of 'reverse engineering' digital humanities projects, with an eye to the problems of wrangling the data. What projects strike you as 'hey, I'd like to do that!' ? What kind of 'wrangling' do these projects do? What do you want to know more about? Write your responses as notes in your open notebook, and use the 'issues' button on this page to alert us to your observations.
