weekly in-class presentations
=============

These presentations are made with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). They can be viewed here as markdown formatted files (and so, printed nicely). Here they are [live](http://hist3907b-winter2015.github.io/presentations/#/).

Here's [how to host reveal.js on github](https://cynng.wordpress.com/2014/10/08/using-reveal-js-on-github-pages-for-your-presentations/).

[Module 1 Session 1 - Open Access Scholarship Discussion Points](http://hist3907b-winter2015.github.io/presentations/wk2-1.html)

[Module 1 Session 2 - We discussed the exercises and engaged in some troubleshooting to get everyone up to speed.

Module 2 Session 1 - Finding Data. There was no slide deck for this day. Rather, I discussed the readings for Module 2 in terms of computing history, the evolution of search, the nature of the early Web and early search engines. We talked about the ways 'search' was not theorized, and the implications of that for how we find data online. We talked about the various ways we might encounter data online, and we walked through the resources for and introudction to the exercises.

Module 2 Session 2 - Search & Research - Shawn Anctil. Shawn Anctil, a PhD student in the Department here, came and talked about the ways one could use the artefacts of the search process itself as fodder for asking good historical questions - especially in terms of public history. He demonstrated the use of various tools and analytics for exploring these.

Module 2 Session 3 - In the Discovery Centre in the Library. APIs; wget; collaboration and connections; Twitter Search & its API and @edsu's TWARC, NodeXL.
