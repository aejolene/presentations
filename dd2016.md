### Draft

####[The Gothic] aimed to produce emotionally vertiginous shocks and thrills;<br> sensations of any kind, in fact, so long as they put the viewing subject - the 'Self' - at the centre of the experience.
<br>
#### -> Richard Marggraf Turley

#### "The goal<br> was to <br>overwhelm <br>the senses,<br> to annihilate<br> 'Self'."

#### The world of information is more Gothic <br>than its believers believe, <br>because it is ghostly, <br>silhouette-like, deprived of human sentience

### The sublime ... er big data ... will save us

Note:
Kurzweil, obviously. painting: Martin Myrone encourages us to think of artistic engagement with, and deployment of, the sublime as primarily market driven, thus categorising it as a somewhat knowing and cynical enterprise. ‘The reality of commercial spectacle and sensation,’ he states, "was accommodated to a revised notion of ideal art through the eighteenth century notion of the sublime, the aesthetic celebration of grandeur and horror for its stimulation effects ... By the late eighteenth century the term had become commonplace with improvised, informal and often half-baked writing that then passed as art criticism, where it typically functioned as a ‘buzzword’ that had a certain currency without being fully theorized." He concludes that the sublime can ‘probably best be described as a certain kind of effect which had more to do with manipulating public and critical response than with attending to some pre-ordained theoretical prescription.’ http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/christine-riding-shipwreck-self-preservation-and-the-sublime-r1133015

## Frankenstein's Monster
+ sometimes, things are cliches because they are fundamentally _true_.

Big data, like the Gothic, lacks context.

Note:
Like the sublime, we get caught up in the seductive mass of the numbers.
