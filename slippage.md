What's more interesting? <br> The idea of an illegal scan? <br> Or the idea of data theft?

When my class printed out that 'liberated' data file, what crime are we committing?

- is it an IP crime?

- is it a continuation of the looting of Egypt?

- is it a kind of partage?

- is it a crime at all?

The Palmyrene arch

Note: look at the associations of space within trafalgar square, too 

--

- a neo-colonialism?
- a digital colonialism?
- an argument in support of Assad?
- digital tech is never _neutral_

---

- archaeological data are meaningful insofar as they have context
- is the scan (whatever its 'reality') meaningful, archaeologically?

- 3d scans of objects in the present are archaeologically meaningful only within the archaeological present

Well, maybe.

Note: 2013 consumer electronics show- was on display. visually impaired, touching, etc. also note the 'remix' count, that someone was taking this apart to make something new.

Note: BM making things downloadable now; 2.5k downloads on this one alone. No need to heist?

- Smearing from the physical into the digital: we get it. It makes 'sense'.
- We call it 'digitization'

- What happens if we smear from the digital into the physical?

### Buying and Selling Human Remains on Instagram

![img](bonetradesampler.png)
Note:
Big data from culling the posts gives me some insight, esp when I represent as vector models, some of the explicit language behind this trade, and ways that people signal that something is for sale. But it also misses the visual signals in the composition of the images itself. For that, I have to go in and read these hidden cues - rather like a kind of steganography that is explicitly meant to conceal the trade from algorithmic monitoring. This kind of reaction is also present on Facebook or Twitter as people 'template' themselves for particular audiences. The danger is that these templated selves could become algorithmic prisons: our performances in reaction to alogorithms that make assumptions about how the world work cease to become performances and instead become real. This is big data gothic.

Note: human bones, human skulls, context-less, literal things. turned into digital images for ease of trade. often not with any other meta data than a tag #humanbone or #humanskull; how do these people signal that something is for sale? Sometimes, quite baldly stating:

Note: clearly, there is something going on. This is hue v. saturation.

### Blurring to create intelligibility

![Tara Copplestone Watercolor](copplestone-watercolor.png)

Note:
photobashing ... occupies a liminal position in archae because it puts 'something captured through a mechanical process through a subjective one'
Value in it- because it 'sit[s] at an intersection of subjective processes and mechanical capture, allows for some interesting interactions and reflexivity between both sides of this discussion'. Photobashing is deformation.

--

- Hue, Colour, Saturation.
- 3 notes. A chord.
- Sound?

[![Smash Mouth All-Star mp3-to-midi-to-mp3](http://img.youtube.com/vi/L_jWHffIx5E/0.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/149070596)

Note: we fill in gaps in the sound with our expectations. Consider this video where the mp3 has been converted to MIDI back to mp3; the music has been ‘flattened’ so that all sonic information is being played by one instrument. (Generating this effect is rather like saving a webpage as .txt, opening it in Word, and then resaving it as .html). All sounds (including vocals) have been translated to their corresponding note values, and then turned back into an mp3. It is noisy; yet we perceive meaning…  If we sonify our data, and begin to hear patterns in the sound, or odd outliers, our cultural expectations about how music works (our memories of similar snippets of music, heard in particular contexts) are going to colour our interpretation. This I would argue is true about all representations of the past, but sonifying is just odd enough to our regular methods that this self-awareness will help us identify or communicate the critical patterns in the (data of the) past.

- 3 axes. Space.
- Volume?

# Blur

- yadda yadda something about what I'm now thinking
- Digitization, smearing back and forth from analogue to digital and back - it's not about the object itself. It's what it does to how I think that matters. It's a method to think about a world in which nearly perfect replicas are shortly to arrive. It's a method to think... something from R&S's hermenuetica. Whalen's imj.
- A physical/sonic corollary to those tools.
